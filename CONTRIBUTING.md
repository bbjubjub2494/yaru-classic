## Contributing Icons
All Suru icons are created using the free and open source [Inkscape](http://inkscape.org) vector editor, so it is recommended that you do the same to create Suru icons. To contribute to the Suru icon set, open a pull request to this repository with your icon(s).

Use of icon names in line with the [FreeDesktop.Org Icon Naming Specification](http://standards.freedesktop.org/icon-naming-spec/icon-naming-spec-latest.html) is encouraged.

See [src/README.md](/src/README.md) for more details about the structure of the `src` folder.

## Notes

 - The Suru icons **will not attempt to supply icons for third-party apps**. Pull requests to add icons or symbolic links that would overwrite the branding of third-party apps will be rejected.
 - Suru development is currently focused the GNOME desktop, changes regarding other desktop environments (such as MATE or KDE) are not currently a priority but pull requests regarding those desktops are welcome and will be reviewed.
