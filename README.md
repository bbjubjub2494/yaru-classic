# Ubuntu GTK+ 2 and 3 Communitheme

Ubuntu GTK+ 2 and 3 community theme.

## Installing & Using

This is a very early pre-release version of the theme. This package is intended for the Communitheme designers to get a sense of what actually works in Ubuntu. Many icons are missing, some stuff is just a white squircle. You will find issues and **stuff will break**. We'll make a public statement when this theme is ready for a wider audience.

Install Communitheme in order to get this gtk Theme. [How to install Communitheme](https://github.com/Ubuntu/gnome-shell-communitheme/blob/master/README.md).
