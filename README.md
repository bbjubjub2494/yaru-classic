# Suru Icon Theme

This project is a revitalization of the Suru icon set that was designed for Ubuntu Touch. The principles and styles created for Suru now serve as the basis for a new FreeDesktop icon theme.

This specific repo is a mirror of the upstream Suru repo from Sam that includes the Communitheme build system.

## Installing & Using

This is a very early pre-release version of the theme. This package is intended for the Communitheme designers to get a sense of what actually works in Ubuntu. Many icons are missing, some stuff is just a white squircle. You will find issues and **stuff will break**. We'll make a public statement when this theme is ready for a wider audience.

Install Communitheme in order to get this icon theme. [How to install Communitheme](https://github.com/Ubuntu/gnome-shell-communitheme/blob/master/README.md).

## Contributor Notes

- Pull requests regarding branded, third-party application icons (for example, Google Chrome) will be rejected. Infringing upon third-party brands is a no-no in this set.
- Development is focused on targeting the GNOME desktop, changes regarding other desktop environments (such as MATE or KDE) are not currently a priority.
- See the README in the [icon sources folder](/src) for more about how to contribute or modify icons
