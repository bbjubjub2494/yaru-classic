# Ubuntu Communitheme

Communitheme is the new Ubuntu theme built by the Community.

## Installing & Using

This is a very early pre-release version of the theme. This package is intended for the Communitheme designers to get a sense of what actually works in Ubuntu. Many icons are missing, some stuff is just a white squircle. You will find issues and **stuff will break**. We'll make a public statement when this theme is ready for a wider audience.

Install Communitheme in order to get this Shell Theme. [How to install Communitheme](https://github.com/ubuntu/communitheme-snap-helpers/blob/master/README.md).
