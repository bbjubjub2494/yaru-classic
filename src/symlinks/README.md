## Symbolic Links

 - To save on space many icons are just symbolic links to generic icons.
 - To simplify link generation, and to keep track of all links, each list in each folder corresponds to a icon `context`
 - To generate symlinks icons you will need `symlinks` and you'll need `ruby` installed to run the render script.

 - [fullcolor](./fullcolor) - the list files for symbolic icon links
 - [symbolic](./symbolic) -  the list files for fullcolor icon links
 - [generate-symlinks.sh](./generate-symlinks.sh) - the generation script
